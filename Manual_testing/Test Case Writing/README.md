# Test Case Writing

Welcome to the **Test Case Writing** folder of our project repository. This section is dedicated to documenting test cases for software, ensuring that all functionalities are properly verified and validated. The purpose of this folder is to maintain a comprehensive set of test cases for applications. Proper test cases help in identifying bugs, ensuring the software meets its requirements, and maintaining the quality of the product.

## How to Write Test Cases

When writing test cases, please adhere to the following format:

1. **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
2. **Test Description**: A brief description of what the test case is verifying.
3. **Preconditions**: Any prerequisites that must be met before executing the test.
4. **Test Steps**: A step-by-step list of actions to perform the test.
5. **Expected Results**: The expected outcome of the test.
6. **Actual Results**: The actual outcome after test execution (to be filled after execution).
7. **Test Status**: The result of the test Pass/Fail (to be marked after execution).
